**Principal AI Architect specializing in Graph-RAG systems and enterprise AI transformation**

Currently preventing million-dollar compliance failures and transforming enterprise AI adoption through production-grade Graph-RAG architectures and LLM orchestration at scale.

## Impact at Scale

| Metric | Impact | Context |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **$17M** | Compliance fine prevented | 48-hour emergency OCR pipeline, 20,000+ documents |
| **0→70%** | AI adoption rate | Transformed 500+ employees across all departments in 8 months |
| **98%** | Time reduction | Caregiver matching: 5 hours → minutes across 96 branches |
| **2 sec** | Query response time | Graph-RAG system processing thousands of daily transcripts |
| **40 hrs/week** | Manual work eliminated | 100% automation with 95% accuracy |
